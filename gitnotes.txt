--> repository - the container which we are tracking

--> to convert a folder to a git repository use
	$git init
	what we see inside the folder remains all same it is just that the tracking can be done

--> whenever any change is made in the repository created we have to do the following things
	$git add --a
	$git commit -m "Message"	

--> WIT: Think that there are four regions - untracked, modified, stagged, committed
	untracked - those files whose contents are unknown to git. It knows that such a file exists but if any changes are made then it cannot recognize that a change has been made.
	stagged - those files which has been given 'git add' command. If u give commit then the version of the file while doing git add will be snapshotted
	modified - a file is in stagged region. Now changes are made to it. So the unchanged version remains in the stagged state and the changed version comes to modified state. If a git commit is done, the unchanged version is committed. Before committing, if git add is given the old version in stagged region gets replaced with the new one and there wont be any memory of the old one.
	committed - those files in stagged state when committed moves to commit state ie. their snapshot has been saved now
	
--> if on giving git status, if we get green coloured things then it means that those are files in stagged state which has not been committed. Once committed they move out of the stagged state
	if it comes in red colour then it means that those files are not present in stagged state but are being tracked
	
--> if we don't want git to ignore some files (not even care about its presence) then make a file .gitignore and then type the names of the files to be ignored

--> if we want to ignore all files of a particular extension eg all .log files then inside .gitignore write *.log
	in case of directory write directoryname/

--> git by default ignores blank folders (doesn't even bother its presence)

--> git diff command
	shows the difference between files in staged state to its current version in working directory
	
--> to show the difference between files in staged state and its previously committed version, use the following command
	git diff --staged
	
--> to commit all the tracked files without putting them into stagging state (direct commit), use the following command
	git commit -a -m "Message"
