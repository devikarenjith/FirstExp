--> repository - the container which we are tracking

--> to convert a folder to a git repository use
	$git init
	what we see inside the folder remains all same it is just that the tracking can be done

--> whenever any change is made in the repository created we have to do the following things
	$git add --a
	$git commit -m "Message"
